# Development Plan for Conceptual Color Bead Sorting System

This development plan outlines a two-phase approach—Research and Design—for conceptualizing a color-based bead sorting system for your sensors and actuators class. The system focuses on separating yellow and blue beads using a hardware-driven, non-programmed approach, emphasizing sensor-actuator synergy without reliance on a controls narrative. Specific components are not required, so the plan prioritizes general principles and conceptual design informed by real-world examples.

## 1. Research Phase
Study real-world examples of color sorting machines to understand their operational principles, focusing on non-programmed, physics-driven mechanisms for sorting small objects like beads. The goal is to identify common design patterns and adapt them for a conceptual solution.

- **Study Objectives**:
  - Investigate how optical sensors detect color differences in real-world applications, such as distinguishing hues based on light reflectance or absorption properties.
  - Explore mechanical diversion methods (e.g., flaps, air jets, or gravity-driven paths) that respond directly to sensor signals without sequential programming.
  - Analyze system designs that leverage inherent material properties and environmental dynamics for sorting, avoiding complex control logic.
- **Sources to Explore**:
  - Industrial color sorters (e.g., used in agriculture for sorting grains or seeds) that employ optical sensors and pneumatic actuators for high-speed sorting. These often use simple thresholding circuits for real-time diversion.
  - Educational DIY projects, such as hobbyist sorting machines, which demonstrate gravity-fed chutes or conveyor systems paired with optical detection for small objects.
  - Technical literature on sensor-actuator integration in mechatronics, focusing on analog signal processing for immediate mechanical response.
- **Methodology**:
  - Review online resources like engineering blogs, open-source project repositories, and academic articles to gather insights on sorting mechanisms.
  - Document findings in a research log, noting key principles (e.g., spectral differentiation for color, mechanical bistability for diversion) and their applicability to bead sorting.
  - Synthesize pros and cons of observed designs, such as the trade-off between speed and accuracy in passive sorting systems.
- **Expected Outcomes**:
  - A clear understanding of how real-world systems achieve color-based sorting through direct sensor-actuator coupling.
  - A list of general design strategies (e.g., single-file bead flow, threshold-based actuation) to inform the conceptual design.
- **Timeline**: 1-2 weeks, allowing time to compile a comprehensive research log for reference in the design phase.

## 2. Design Phase
Develop a conceptual framework for a bead sorting system that separates yellow and blue beads, focusing on emergent behavior from sensor-actuator interactions rather than specific components or programmed steps.

- **Conceptual Framework**:
  - **Feed Mechanism**: Envision a sloped channel or vibrating surface that aligns beads into a single-file stream using gravity or gentle mechanical agitation, ensuring consistent presentation to the sensing zone without timed controls.
  - **Color Detection**: Conceive an optical sensing zone where beads’ reflective properties (yellow’s warmer, longer wavelengths vs. blue’s cooler, shorter wavelengths) produce distinct electrical signals. The sensor, conceptually a light-responsive device, generates an analog output that varies with color intensity.
  - **Diversion Mechanism**: Design a mechanical diverter, such as a pivoting gate or air pulse, activated directly by the sensor’s signal crossing a predefined threshold. One color follows a default path (e.g., straight through), while the other triggers a physical shift to an alternate path, leveraging bead momentum for separation.
  - **Collection**: Plan for two receiving bins with sloped or cushioned surfaces to prevent bead bouncing, ensuring clean separation.
- **Design Principles**:
  - Emphasize passive or semi-passive operation, where the system’s behavior emerges from physical interactions (e.g., light reflection, mechanical inertia) rather than orchestrated steps.
  - Incorporate adaptability for bead variations (e.g., size or glossiness) through adjustable detection thresholds or flexible mechanical design.
  - Ensure robustness against environmental factors, like ambient light, by conceptualizing shielding or consistent illumination in the sensing zone.
- **Deliverables**:
  - A detailed written description of the conceptual system, outlining how sensor signals drive actuation without programmed logic.
  - Hand-drawn or CAD-generated sketches illustrating the system layout, including the feed path, sensing zone, diverter, and bins.
  - A rationale section explaining how the design draws from real-world examples and addresses class objectives (e.g., avoiding controls narratives).
- **Timeline**: 1-2 weeks, producing a cohesive conceptual design document suitable for class submission.

This two-phase plan ensures a thorough understanding of real-world color sorting principles and their application to a conceptual bead sorting system. Total estimated time: 2-4 weeks, adaptable to class deadlines.
