## 📜 Narrative & Observations


- **Narrative Summary:**  
- Started out by seeking advice from Carl on creating my development plan and clarifying class structure. Also got some tips for project management and engineering. Found out that I may have deleted my OneDrive files during my virtual machine experimentation, So I decided to create new templates and documents in Markdown format as I find it cooperates with AI. Utilized AI tools like Copilot and Grok to help draft the development plan and report template. Spent some time researching fluid sensors and systems. Felt a bit inspired by the different applications available.
- **Technical Notes:**
- I will be using an external drive to back up my files going forward.  
- **Lessons Learned / Insights:** 
-  Learning a lot about different fluid sensors and applications.
- **Emotional/Workflow Reflections (optional):**
- Each project starts with a 'hump' to get over. Starting with the planning/sketching phase is a good foundation.
