## 📜 Narrative & Observations
> _Use this section for detailed descriptions, reflections, and context. Include technical notes, emotional observations, and rationale for decisions._

- **Narrative Summary:** 
- `I reviewed my Adafruit CPX microcontroller kit and found that it came with all the necessary components to build a smart sensor/actuator system. I worked with Grok AI to brainstorm ideas for my system. I will be creating a water tower and container system were capacitive sensors will detect the water level in the container and a servo motor controlled pinch valve will stop the water flow when water reaches a certain level in the container. The water "tower" will be made of PVC pipes with rubber tubing fixed to a hole at the bottom of the tank. The pinch valve I can design with CAD or I could find an existing design I can modify and print. Construction of the tower should be simple. I set up a Python development environment using VSCode and installed the necessary libraries to program the CPX. I finished the initial development plans for Challenges 1-5, challenges 4 and 5 I will need to do more research/sketching on. I'll need to ask if a tension wire fixture will be provided making one might be an issue at home. The CPX has built in accelerometer I can use as a balance sensor. The actuator will need more thought.`
- **Technical Notes:** ''
- **Lessons Learned / Insights:** `Marveling a bit at how productive AI tools can be for brainstorming, planning, and documentation. Feeling optimistic about the project direction so far.`
